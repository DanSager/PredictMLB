Uses ML to predict MLB game outcomes

# Abstract
Among popular sports in America, baseball tends to have one of the closest relations to the world of statistics. As a result, determining the victor of a baseball game before the game is even started is not only possible but can be accurate to a certain extent. One such way to analyze this is by constructing a machine-learning model that can more accurately predict the outcome of a Major League Baseball game than the average baseball fan. As a control sample, three average baseball fans have made their predictions for the entire 2019 Arizona Diamondbacks season. Supervised learning across five different machine-learning classifiers has also been used in an attempt to achieve the highest accuracy possible. Based on the results, it is clear that even with this simple model, machines possess a higher level of accuracy than the control sample and have the potential to reach even higher degrees of accuracy.
